## Installation
Clone the repository into your custom oh-my-zsh themes directory:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/reobin/typewritten.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/typewritten
```

Symlink ``typewritten.zsh-theme`` to your oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:
```shell
ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/typewritten/typewritten.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/typewritten.zsh-theme"
```

Set ``ZSH_THEME="typewritten"`` in your ``.zshrc``.

## Cursor option
Default cursor is ``underscore``, but there is two more options: ``beam`` and ``block``.
They are both configured by adding the `TYPEWRITTEN_CURSOR` zsh variable to your ``.zshrc``:
```shell
export TYPEWRITTEN_CURSOR="beam"
```

## Singleline verbose option
To change the left prompt from:
```shell
>
```

to
```shell
user@host >
```
add this option to your `.zshrc`:
```shell
export TYPEWRITTEN_SINGLELINE_VERBOSE=true
```


## Multiline option
Multiline is now supported thanks to [@thbe](https://github.com/thbe). Add this option to your ``.zshrc``:
```shell
export TYPEWRITTEN_MULTILINE=true
```
